# keylogger
This Python script uses the pynput library to create a simple keylogger. It listens for keyboard input, logs each keystroke (both alphanumeric and special keys), and writes them to a file named log.txt. The logging stops when the Esc key is pressed. All keystrokes are saved with spacing for readability.
